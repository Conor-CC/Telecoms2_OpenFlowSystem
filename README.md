# TelecomsII_OpenFlowSystem
Project to design and implement a simulation of an OpenFlow network system with a Controller, 
multiple clients and an MxN grid of routers. All links between routers are assigned an arbritrary
time and routing is calculated with the famous Dijkstra Algorithm for the shortest path based 
on these times. App is compiled when in src folder, using java -cp tcdlib.jar:. *.java
App can be run then with java -cp tcdlib.jar:. Main   
(This is the first time ive used GitHub properly so bear with me lol)
